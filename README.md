# Getting started:
Fork and clone this repository, and run

    npm install

Inside the repository.

Start editing the **src/app.js** file for the react part, and **src/server/server.ts** for the express.js server part.

Run:

    npm run dev

This will start the react app and the server app at the same time, with hot reload enabled for both of them.

React app will run on **localhost:3000** and the express server needs to be created, to run on **localhost:3001**.

You should use:

    import cors from "cors";
    app.use(cors());

to enable CORS for the express.js server, so that it accepts http requests from the react app.
